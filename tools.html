      <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/"><b>R for Data Science</b></a> 
		by Hadley Whickham & Garrett Grolemund


      The free online textbook we will be using for the first few weeks while you're finding your feet with R, data, and tidyverse.
		
      <hr>
      
      <a href="https://cran.csiro.au/"><b>R</b></a> 
		We will be using the R programming language and associated visualisation packages to explore the wide world of data viz.

		<hr>

 <a href="https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/"><b>R Studio</b></a> 
		R Studio is the integrated development environment (IDE) we will be using to work in R. It's free to download and use.

		<hr>

<a href="https://zoom.us"><b>Zoom</b> </a> Workshops will be available in person or on Zoom each week, starting in Week 2. Lectures will be in short streamable or downloadable videos, not over Zoom.

<a href="https://join.slack.com/t/dataviz2021mxb262/shared_invite/zt-kx3z5oav-QaNUhIXghMERjmJeBxSBBg"><b>Unit Slack page</b> </a> All your communications with the teaching team and other students (outside of class) will be via Slack. This link takes you straight to the unit page, where you can easily register using your QUT email address for free. You can then either access Slack through the browser, a downloadable desktop application, or an app on your phone/tablet. All are free. 

Slack is becoming widely used in tech companies and in academia as a replacement for (or complement to) email. It's quick and easy to send messages to the whole group, to a smaller group chat, or one-on-one without getting bogged down in someone's email inbox. Many of the School of Mathematical Sciences' industry partner companies who hire our graduates use Slack, and lots of our graduates (i.e. maybe you in a couple of years!) use this tool every day.

<a href="https://blackboard.qut.edu.au">
<b> Blackboard</b>
</a>
  All your materials will be avaialable here on this unit website, and all communication will happen on Slack. Blackboard will just serve as an assignment interface -- this is where you'll submit all of your assessment, and where you'll get your marks back.
