  <h1 style="margin-top:10px">Assessment</h1>
  <p> Assessment in this unit has been designed to slowly introduce you to and assess you on visual communication theory, the practical skill of making visualisations, and programming in R. The assessment builds skills iteratively, so it is highly recommended that you attempt each assessment.  <br /><br /></p>


  <h2>Problem Solving Tasks</h2>
  <p>Problem Solving Tasks  build upon the weekly workshop sheet. You'll be asked to demonstrate the skills from the workshop and build upon them to create and critique new and existing visualisations. You will not be able to complete your PSTs without first working fully through the workshop sheet for the practical skills, and watching the week's lectures for the theory you'll need in order to make and justify your choices.
  
  Problem solving tasks will consist of multiple questions, which may be short answer, completing a task (e.g. posting to slack), or creating a visualisation using ggplot2 in R. You will often be asked to justify choices you have made in your visualisations, which requires you to link the practical workshop to the theory learned in the lectures or readings.
  
    You will be given one week to complete the Problem Solving Tasks, which will always be due on Mondays at 11:59pm. No questions will be answered after 5pm on Monday afternoons on Slack, so be mindful about asking for help.
    
    Any cheating or plaguirism in these Problem Solving Tasks will result in a grade of 0 for the Problem Solving Task, failure of the unit, and academic disciplinary action. Cheating includes using code found online without proper attribution, posting to or using solutions from contract cheating websites, and use of any code or justification from current or past students. </p>

  <h2>Mid-semester Project</h2>
  <p> The mid-semester project examines your ability to analyse, critique, and improve existing visualisations using theory learned throughout the unit. This will be presented as a recorded video oral presentation and associated written submission. You will be expected to watch other students' presentations.
  
  You will be critiquing both good and bad examples of visualisations you find in the wild, so it's a good idea to keep an eye out for visualisations starting early. 
	</p>

  <h2>Final Project</h2>
  <p> Your final project is your time to shine. You will create completely new visualisations from data you find yourself. You have free reign on the topic, dataset, and visualisations (within some guidelines). You will use these visualisations to tell a clear story to a specific audience. You will a short oral presentation on video explaining novel data visualisations you have created, including  motivations, justifications, and theories behind the practical application of data visualisation learned throughout the unit. You will submit and be assessed on the code, and a written summary of the project in addition to the oral presentation. You will be expected to watch other students' presentations.
  
  There will be at least one formal touch-point throughout the semester when progress toward the project will be discussed with the teaching team.
  
  It is a good idea to start thinking early about the type of topic or data you might be on the lookout for, and what kind of messages you may like to construct.

<h5>Life Happens Card</h5>

Life is tough, and we are all people just trying to do our best. If something goes wrong and you can't get a Problem Solving Task completed by the deadline, you have one 'Life Happens Card' to play at any point throughout the semester. Email Kate before the due date and let me know that you're using your 'Life Happens Card' (no explanation needed), and you'll get a judgement- and penalty-free 3-day extension on that Problem Solving Task. Any other extensions must go through the formal extension process, so I suggest keeping this in your back pocket until you really need it (or until the last one!).

<div class="panel">

  <h1 style="margin-top:10px">Attendance and Participation</h1>

  Attendance and participation in the timetabled workshops is not compulsory, but is strongly encouraged. There is a strong practical side to this unit, and a fairly steep learning curve at the beginning that can throw up annoying technical roadblocks, so it's really useful to come to the workshops to get help as you need it. Please watch the lectures before the workshops, and either plan to work through the workshop sheet during the allotted time or try it beforehand and come with questions. 
  
  People who participate fully in the workshops and consultations tend to do far better in this unit.

<button class="accordion">Academic Honesty</button>
<div class="panel">
  <br>
  <p>You are expected to comply to the rules set by the QUT with regards to academic intrgrity.
      You cannot share or distribute solutions online or offline or in any media now or in the future.
      You cannot obtain solutions from others.
     It is your responsibility to protect your answers being copied.</p>

<button class="accordion">Studying with a disability, injury, or health condition</button>
<div class="panel">
  <br>
  <p>If you have a disability, injury or health condition that is permanent, temporary, episodic or fluctuating, Disability Services can assist you plan for and participate in your studies.

Disability Services are part of QUT Student Services, which promotes inclusion and participation for all students in their study. Our Disability Advisers are available at both campuses and offer appointments in person or via phone, Zoom/Skype or the National Relay Service.

If you are eligible, I strongly recommend registering with, or having a chat with, <a href="https://qutvirtual4.qut.edu.au/group/student/study/studying-with-a-disability-injury-or-health-condition/register-for-services"> Disability Services</a>. Even if you do not feel that you need it now or all the time, it can be very useful to have this on file in case you do need it. Accommodations can include things like extensions on assignments, a separate room for exams, snack or bathroom breaks in exams, transcription services, and more. Health conditions included are very broad, and include mental health issues like anxiety, depression, sleep disorder, many more. Students speak very highly of the Disability Services team, they are a really skilled and lovely bunch.

<button class="accordion">Inclusion</button>

<div class="panel">
  <br>
<p>   My goal in this unit and in general is to make all people feel comfortable and included in mathematics, data science, and programming. If at any point you do not feel included in this unit, please don't hesitate to reach out. I aim to pre-empt any potential issues, but am  fallible and want to fix any problems as soon as they arise.

Mathematics and data science are for everyone. Absolutely no language or action will be tolerated that treats anyone differently on the basis of gender identity, sexuality, race, religioun, health, disability, or nationality. 

Creating a culture of inclusion needs everyone to participate. Any behaviour that excludes your fellow students or makes them uncomfortable in this space won't be tolerated. We are all here to learn together, and we learn better as a team. Let's act like it, and build the community we would like to see.

In the modern online world, the boundaries about what counts as 'the classroom' has been massively extended. You are expected to act with professionalism and within QUT policy in all forums through which you interact with your peers -- whether that be online or in person.
