# Load and wrangle data

Load two CSV files and join them to create a data frame named `religion_utah` (i.e. using `religions` as the main data frame, left join `religion_names` to it)

```{r load-libraries-religion-data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

religions <- read_csv("data/religion_utah.csv")
religion_names <- read_csv("data/religion_names.csv")
```

```{r wrangle-data}
# Do something to add the names of the religions
religion_utah <- religions
```


# Answer questions

Answer the following questions. I occasionally provide a chunk of code to help you get started. 

## General religious landscape

### Top religions

What are the top 10 religions in Utah, based on number of adherents?

```{r top-10-adherents}
top_10_adherents <- religion_utah %>% 
  group_by(religion_clean) %>% 
  summarize(total = sum(adherents, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  top_n(10, total) %>% 
  arrange(desc(total))

top_10_adherents
```

Make a bar plot of the top 10 religions in Utah, by adherents:

```{r top-10-adherents-plot}
# Here we make a copy of the top_10_adherents data from above and we
# change/mutate the `religion_clean` column so that the religion labels are in
# order (that's what `fct_inorder()` does---it converts `religion_clean` into a
# list of categories and puts them in a specific order)
top_10_adherents_plot <- top_10_adherents %>% 
  mutate(religion_clean = fct_inorder(religion_clean))

# Notice the `fct_rev()` here. That takes the list of categories in
# `religion_clean` and reverses them. If they're not reversed, they'll be
# plotted from lowest to highest, and LDS will be at the bottom.
#
# Also notice the `coord_flip()` layer. This rotates the plot so the bars go
# horizontally intead of vertically
ggplot(top_10_adherents_plot, aes(x = fct_rev(religion_clean), y = total)) +
  geom_col() + 
  labs(x = "Denomination", y = "Number of adherents") +
  coord_flip()
```


Which 10 religions have the most number of congregations?

```{r top-10-congregations}

```

Make a bar plot of the top 10 religions in Utah, by congregations:

```{r top-10-congregations-plot}

```


Why are Catholics ranked differently in the two tables? xxxx


### Proportion of membership in total population

Utah's total population in 2010 was 2,763,885. Calculate the proportion of each of the top 10 religions based on this population (i.e. Catholics made up X percent of Utah's population in 2010).

Hint: copy the code from the `top-10-adherents` chunk above and use `mutate()` to create a new column.

```{r top-10-adherents-percent}

```


## LDS membership

Which 5 counties in Utah have the most LDS members (or adherents)?

```{r top-5-lds-adherents}
religion_utah %>% 
  filter(religion_clean == "LDS") %>% 
  top_n(5, adherents) %>% 
  arrange(desc(adherents)) %>% 
  select(county, religion_clean, adherents)
```

Which 5 counties in Utah have the most LDS congregations?

```{r top-5-lds-congregations}

```

Which 5 counties in Utah have the highest proportion of LDS members? (i.e. `adherents_per_1000`)

```{r top-5-lds-proportion}

```

Why are these answers not all the same? xxxx


## Non-LDS membership

What are the top 5 non-LDS religions in Utah, based on number of adherents?

```{r top-5-non-lds-adherents}

```


Which 10 counties have the highest proportion (`adherents_per_1000`) of non-LDS religions? What are those religions?

```{r top-10-non-lds-counties}

```

Which 5 counties have the highest proportion of Muslims?

```{r top-5-muslims}

```

Which 5 counties have the highest proportion of Buddhists?

```{r top-5-buddhists}

```
