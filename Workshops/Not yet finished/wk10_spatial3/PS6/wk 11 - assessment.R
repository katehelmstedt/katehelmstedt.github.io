### ASSESSMENT  Wk 11 - Intro to data vis


##### 2. Create a hexmap using data from any year other than 2016 (data is in the eechidna package). Restrict the map to only show the state you were born in, (if you weren't born in Australia select any state). Create two different maps showing two different demographic variables.  Customise the map using the features of ggplot() you have learnt throughout this semester. 

#extension - see if you can show both maps at oncee using facet_warp().  



##### 1. Use what you've learnt about creating a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to plot a Digital Surface Model (DSM). use the following steps   

# A. Create an R object called DSM from the raster: SJER2013_DSM.tif. 
# B. Convert the raster data from m to feet. What is that conversion again? Oh, right 1m = ~3.3ft. (could leave this in so they have to do a raster calculation)
# C. Plot the DSM using a custom color map.
# D. Create numeric breaks in the legend that makes sense given the distribution of the data. Hint, your breaks might represent high elevation, medium elevation, low elevation. You'll need to look at a histogram to see the distribution of the data.
